    This exercise helps in understanding the relationship between swing-stance

    Implement rigid spine with limb movements to understand the relationship.
    Hint:
        - Use the spine's nominal amplitude to make the spine rigid.

    Observer the limb phase output plot versus ground reaction forces.
        - Apply a threshold on ground reaction forces to remove small signals
        - Identify phase at which the limb is in the middle of stance
        - Identify which senstivity function is better suited for implementing
        tegotae feedback for our CPG-controller.

        to get the right coordination
